This repository contains a Matlab implementation of the Gaussian process conditional logit model described in the paper: `A Gaussian Process Conditional Logit Choice Model Reveals Homophily in Household Neighbourhood Choice in Stockholm' by R.P. Mann, V. Spaiser, L. Hedman and D.J.T. Sumpter.

Original data analysed in the paper is not available for public access. Instead, simulated data is presented, generated using a simple neighbourhood choice utility function to verify that the code is functional.

The repository also contains a copy of the minFunc toolkit:

Use of code is demonstrated in the script: gp_conditional_logit_model.m
